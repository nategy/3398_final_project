Learned/Enjoyed:
-One thing we enjoyed was having more liberty to take our project in whichever direction we wanted. It was nice/interesting to talk about potential app ideas with
classmates, and seeing where our creativities branched off from there.
-(Felix Speaking) Personally I have not worked on too many CS group projects in the past, so this project was a good learning experience for me.

Things we didn't enjoy: - fly - flask and react

Technical Requirnments: - flask - beautification
